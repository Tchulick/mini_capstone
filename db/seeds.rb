# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# new_product_1 = Product.new({ name: "Long Sword", price: 15, description: "One handed sword that is very versatile." })
# new_product_1.save

# new_product_2 = Product.new({ name: "Plate mail", price: 200, description: "Heavy armor, covering the body in metal plates." })
# new_product_2.save
